# Development Workflow Rules

## MANDATORY: Always Check .dev First

Before performing ANY coding task, **read `.dev/README.md`** for complete project context and workflow.

## Essential Commands

✅ Use `make` commands (defined in `.dev/README.md`)
⚠️ Ensure `make lint` and `make test` always pass before committing
